# Complex Control Shapes - Visual Reference Guide

## Shape Anatomy and Visual Comparison

This guide provides visual descriptions and ASCII art representations of each complex control shape to aid in understanding their appearance and use cases.

## 1. Chickenhead Pointer

### Visual Description
The chickenhead pointer is a tapered indicator that starts wide at the base (near the knob center) and narrows dramatically to a point at the tip (outer edge). This creates a distinctive arrow-like appearance characteristic of vintage hardware.

### ASCII Representation (Top View)
```
           *              ← Narrow tip (1/6 of base width)
          * *
         *   *
        *     *
       *       *
      *         *
     *           *
    *             *       ← Wide base (full width parameter)
   *****************      ← Inner radius (knob center)
```

### Key Characteristics
- Taper ratio: 6:1 (base to tip)
- Best visibility: Medium to large knobs (1-3 units)
- Aesthetic: Vintage, retro, classic

### Usage Notes
- Width parameter of 0.14-0.18 provides authentic appearance
- Ideal for recreating classic guitar amplifiers
- Works well with high-contrast faceplate colors

## 2. Knurl Pattern

### Visual Description
A knurl consists of 12 evenly-spaced rectangular notches arranged in a ring pattern around the control's outer edge. This creates a serrated appearance similar to precision knobs found on scientific instruments.

### ASCII Representation (Top View)
```
        ___                    ← Individual notch
       /   \    ___
      |     |  /   \
   ___|     |_|     |___
  /                     \
 |    ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○    |     ← 12 notches around edge
  \___________________/
      |     |  |     |
       \___/    \___/
```

### Key Characteristics
- Fixed notch count: 12
- Notch thickness: Controlled by width parameter
- Best visibility: Small knobs (< 1 unit diameter)
- Aesthetic: Precision, technical, professional

### Usage Notes
- Width parameter of 0.08 provides subtle detail
- Appears as a textured edge rather than individual pointers
- Ideal for Q controls, frequency adjustments, and fine-tuning parameters

## 3. D-Line Pointer

### Visual Description
A D-line pointer combines a straight line shaft with a semicircular cap at the outer end, creating a "D" shape when viewed from the side. This provides clear directional indication while maintaining a clean, modern appearance.

### ASCII Representation (Top View)
```
           ___
          ( o )          ← Semicircular cap
           |||           ← Line shaft
           |||
           |||
        ─────────        ← Inner radius
```

### Key Characteristics
- Line shaft with rounded end
- Cap radius: Equal to half the line width
- Best visibility: Medium to large knobs (2-4 units)
- Aesthetic: Modern, clean, contemporary

### Usage Notes
- Provides softer appearance than standard line pointer
- Width parameter of 0.1 balances visibility and elegance
- Excellent for modern audio interfaces and digital equipment

## 4. Triangle Pointer

### Visual Description
A bold isosceles triangle pointing outward from the knob center. The triangle's base sits at the inner radius, and its apex extends to the outer radius, creating a strong visual indicator.

### ASCII Representation (Top View)
```
              ^
             / \          ← Sharp apex at outer radius
            /   \
           /     \
          /       \
         /         \
        /___________\     ← Wide base at inner radius
```

### Key Characteristics
- Isosceles triangle geometry
- Base width: Controlled by width parameter
- Best visibility: Large knobs (> 3 units)
- Aesthetic: Bold, high-contrast, industrial

### Usage Notes
- Provides maximum visibility in high-contrast situations
- Width parameter of 0.2-0.3 creates bold presence
- Ideal for master volume, main gain, or primary controls

## 5. Arrow Pointer

### Visual Description
A sophisticated two-part pointer consisting of a narrow shaft transitioning to a wider arrowhead. The shaft occupies the first 60% of the length, and the arrowhead occupies the remaining 40%, creating a professional appearance.

### ASCII Representation (Top View)
```
              ^
             /|\          ← Wide arrowhead (full width)
            / | \
           /  |  \
          ────┼────       ← Transition at 60% (shaft to head)
             |||          ← Narrow shaft (1/3 of full width)
             |||
             |||
          ─────────       ← Inner radius
```

### Key Characteristics
- Shaft width: 1/3 of total width parameter
- Arrowhead width: Full width parameter
- Transition point: 60% of total length
- Best visibility: Medium to large knobs
- Aesthetic: Professional, precise, technical

### Usage Notes
- Provides clear directional indication
- Width parameter of 0.12-0.15 balances shaft and head
- Excellent for ratio selectors, mode switches, and precision controls

## Comparative Size Guide

### Small Control (0.5-1.0 unit diameter)
```
Best: Knurl, D-Line
OK: Arrow, Chickenhead
Avoid: Triangle (too bold)
```

### Medium Control (1.0-2.5 unit diameter)
```
Best: Chickenhead, D-Line, Arrow
OK: Knurl, Triangle
```

### Large Control (2.5+ unit diameter)
```
Best: Triangle, Chickenhead, Arrow
OK: D-Line
Avoid: Knurl (too subtle)
```

---

## Rotation Behavior

All complex shapes rotate around the control's center point when mapped to a rotate visual mapping:

### Example: Chickenhead at Different Angles

```
     -135°              -45°               45°              135°
        *                 |*               *|                *
       / \                ||              ||                / \
      /   \               ||              ||               /   \
     /     \              ||              ||              /     \
   ○────────           ○────────       ────────○        ────────○
```

## Alpha Mask Mode Visualization

When using alpha mask mode, the shape defines which parts of the rotating patch are visible:

### Without Alpha Mask (Basic Clip)
```
┌─────────────┐
│ Static Face │    ← Entire region rotates
│   [Shape]   │
└─────────────┘
```

### With Alpha Mask (Carved Pointer)
```
┌─────────────┐
│ Static Face │    ← Background stays still
│   [Carved   │    ← Only pointer rotates (appears carved)
│    Shape]   │
└─────────────┘
```

The result: The pointer appears to be physically carved or etched into the knob surface, creating a more realistic effect for certain hardware styles.

## Color and Contrast Considerations

### High Contrast Shapes
- Triangle: Best for dark pointers on light backgrounds
- Chickenhead: Works well with strong contrast
- Arrow: Maintains visibility with moderate contrast

### Subtle Shapes
- Knurl: Requires careful lighting and contrast
- D-Line: Works with moderate contrast

### Contrast Enhancement Techniques
1. Use alpha mask mode with high-contrast patches
2. Increase width parameter for bolder appearance
3. Adjust innerRadius to increase pointer length
4. Apply brightness/opacity mappings for LED-lit pointers

## Integration with Visual Mappings

### Rotate Mapping
```swift
shape: .chickenhead
mapping: .rotate(min: -135, max: 135)
// Pointer rotates from -135° to 135° based on control value
```

### Brightness Mapping
```swift
shape: .arrow
mapping: .brightness(RangeD(lower: 0.2, upper: 1.0))
// Arrow fades in/out based on control value (LED-like effect)
```

### Combined Mappings (Multi-Region)
```swift
region1: .chickenhead with .rotate()     // Outer pointer
region2: .dot with .brightness()         // Center LED indicator
// Creates complex pointer + LED combination
```

## Best Practices Summary

| Shape       | Ideal Size  | Best For            | Width Range  |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Chickenhead | 1-3 units   | Vintage gear        | 0.12-0.18    |
| Knurl       | 0.5-1 units | Precision controls  | 0.06-0.10    |
| D-Line      | 2-4 units   | Modern interfaces   | 0.08-0.12    |
| Triangle    | 3+ units    | Primary controls    | 0.20-0.30    |
| Arrow       | 1.5-4 units | Professional gear   | 0.10-0.16    |

## Accessibility Considerations

### High Visibility
- Triangle and Chickenhead provide best visibility
- Use with high-contrast colors
- Increase width parameter for better readability

### Subtle Indication
- Knurl and D-Line for professional, understated appearance
- Use in dense control layouts
- Pair with labels for clarity

### Color Blindness
- All shapes work effectively without relying on color
- Shape alone provides sufficient differentiation
- Consider using different shapes for adjacent controls
