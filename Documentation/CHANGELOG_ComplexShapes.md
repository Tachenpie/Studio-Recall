# Complex Control Shapes - Implementation Changelog

## Summary

This update adds support for five new complex control shapes to Studio Recall, enabling more realistic and detailed hardware representation. These shapes integrate seamlessly with the existing control system and are fully compatible with both photorealistic and representational views.

## New Features

### New Shape Types

1. **Chickenhead** - Tapered pointer for vintage knobs
2. **Knurl** - Notched edge indicator for precision controls
3. **D-Line** - Line pointer with semicircular cap
4. **Triangle Pointer** - Bold triangular indicator
5. **Arrow Pointer** - Shaft with arrowhead tip

### User-Facing Changes

- **Shape Picker**: Extended to include all 5 new shapes in both ControlEditorView and ControlInspector
- **Pointer Style Picker**: Alpha mask mode now supports all new pointer styles
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time preview of complex shapes in the region overlay editor
- **Full Customization**: All shapes support configurable width, angle, and radius parameters

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified

#### Core Models (`Studio Recall/Models/Controls.swift`)
- Added 5 new cases to `ImageRegionShape` enum

- Added `drawDLine()` - D-shaped alpha mask with cap
- Added `drawTrianglePointer()` - triangular alpha mask
- Added `drawArrowPointer()` - composite arrow alpha mask
- All functions generate grayscale PNG data for CoreGraphics compositing

#### UI Components

## Implementation Details

### Shape Algorithm Design

All complex shapes follow a consistent parametric design:

```
center: Control region center point
maxRadius: Half of min(width, height)
innerRadius: 0.0-1.0, scaled to maxRadius
outerRadius: 0.0-1.0, scaled to maxRadius
angleOffset: Rotation in degrees (0° = right, -90° = up)
width: Shape-specific dimension (0.0-1.0 scale)
```

### Shape-Specific Logic

- **Chickenhead**: Uses 6:1 taper ratio (base:tip) for authentic vintage appearance (tip = base/6)
- **Knurl**: Fixed 12 notches for balance between detail and performance
- **D-Line**: Semicircular arc drawn with `CGPath.addArc()`
- **Triangle**: Isosceles triangle with base at innerRadius
- **Arrow**: Shaft width = 1/3 of total width, transition point at 60% of total length

### Performance Considerations

- Path generation uses native CoreGraphics primitives
- Knurl notches are pre-calculated for efficiency
- Alpha mask generation is cached until parameters change
- No impact on existing simple shapes (rect, circle)

## Integration

### Existing Systems

The implementation maintains full compatibility with:

- **Visual Mappings**: All shapes work with rotate, brightness, opacity, translate, flip3D, and sprite mappings
- **Alpha Mask System**: Complex shapes generate proper grayscale masks for "carved pointer" effect
- **Region Editor**: Hit testing and overlay rendering work transparently
- **Session Persistence**: JSON encoding/decoding handles all new types
- **Representational View**: Uses existing glyph system, unaffected by shape complexity

### Migration Path

No migration needed:
- Existing sessions load without modification
- New shapes are additive, not breaking changes
- Default shape remains `.circle` for backward compatibility

## Testing

### Unit Test Coverage

- ✅ Shape enum serialization (all 11 shapes)
- ✅ Mask style enum serialization (all 9 styles)
- ✅ MaskParameters with new styles
- ✅ ImageRegion with complex shapes
- ✅ Control with complex shape regions
- ✅ Path generation validity
- ✅ Backward compatibility
- ✅ Edge cases (extreme values, multiple regions)

### Manual Testing Needed

⚠️ The following should be verified in Xcode:

1. **UI Interaction**:
   - Shape picker in ControlEditorView shows all options
   - Pointer style picker in ControlInspector shows all options
   - Real-time preview in region overlay

2. **Visual Rendering**:
   - Chickenhead pointer appears with correct taper
   - Knurl notches are evenly distributed
   - D-Line cap is semicircular
   - Triangle and arrow have correct proportions

3. **Alpha Mask Mode**:
   - Masks generate correctly for all styles
   - Rotating controls show pointer carved into knob
   - Preview overlay displays mask accurately

4. **Performance**:
   - No lag when selecting complex shapes
   - Smooth rotation of controls with complex shapes
   - Acceptable load time for sessions with many complex shapes

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Custom Shapes**: Support for user-provided SVG paths
2. **Shape Library**: Preset collection of common hardware shapes
3. **Advanced Knurl**: Configurable notch count parameter
4. **Multi-Color Shapes**: Support for colored pointers in shapes
5. **Shape Animation**: Transitions between shapes for multi-mode controls

### Known Limitations

- Knurl notch count is fixed at 12 (acceptable for most use cases, future versions may allow customization)
- Complex shapes don't affect representational view (by design - representational mode uses abstract glyphs)
- Arrow and chickenhead proportions are fixed (shaft width, taper ratio, transition point - may become user-configurable in future versions)

**Note:** These limitations are documented in the user-facing documentation to set proper expectations.
