# PR: Direct Shape Instance Manipulation & Marching Ants

## Overview

This pull request implements direct manipulation of shape instances within the FaceplateCanvas, replacing slider-based controls with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. It also restores marching ants visual feedback for individual shape instances, matching the professional editing experience found in graphics software like Photoshop and Illustrator.

## Motivation

The existing simplified shapes system used slider controls in the ControlInspector for adjusting shape instance position, size, and rotation. This approach had several limitations:

1. **Poor Spatial Context**: Difficult to understand positioning without seeing the shape in context
2. **Cluttered Interface**: Inspector filled with many sliders for each shape instance
3. **Non-Intuitive**: Required switching between canvas and inspector
4. **Limited Feedback**: No real-time visual feedback during adjustments

## Solution

### Direct Manipulation Interface

Users can now:
- **Move** shapes by dragging them directly in the canvas
- **Resize** shapes by dragging corner and edge handles
- **Rotate** shapes by dragging a rotation handle above the shape
- **Select** shapes by clicking on them

### Visual Feedback

Selected shapes display:
- **Marching ants outline**: Animated dashed border following the actual shape geometry
- **Resize handles**: 8 handles (4 corners + 4 edges) for precise resizing
- **Rotation handle**: Circular handle above the shape for rotation
- **Handle scaling**: Handles scale with zoom level for consistent interaction

## Implementation

### New Files

1. **ShapeInstanceOverlay.swift** (177 lines)
   - Visual-only overlay rendered in canvas space
   - Displays marching ants outline using dashed strokes
   - Shows manipulation handles (corners, edges, rotation)
   - Automatically rotates and scales with the shape

2. **ShapeInstanceHitLayer.swift** (360 lines)
   - Interactive layer rendered in parent (viewport) space
   - Handles gesture recognition for move, resize, and rotate
   - Manages selection state and callbacks
   - Converts between coordinate systems (parent ↔ canvas ↔ normalized)

### Modified Files

3. **FaceplateCanvas.swift**
   - Added `selectedShapeInstanceId` state tracking
   - Integrated ShapeInstanceOverlay in canvas content
   - Integrated ShapeInstanceHitLayer in overlay content
   - Creates layers for each shape instance in active region

4. **ControlInspector.swift**
   - Removed position X/Y sliders
   - Removed width/height sliders
   - Removed rotation slider
   - Added instructional text: "Drag shape directly in the canvas..."
   - Kept shape type picker and add/remove buttons

5. **ControlShapeTests.swift**
   - Added tests for ShapeInstance creation
   - Added tests for JSON encoding/decoding
   - Added tests for multiple instances in regions

## Features

### Selection
- Click any shape instance to select it
- Selected shape displays handles and marching ants
- Only one shape can be selected at a time
- Selection state maintained during editing

### Movement
- Drag anywhere inside the shape to move it
- Position constrained to region boundaries (0-1)
- Real-time visual feedback during drag
- Smooth tracking with zoom and pan

### Resizing
- **Corner handles**: Drag to resize from that corner
  - Circles maintain square aspect ratio
  - Rectangles/triangles allow independent width/height
- **Edge handles**: Drag to resize along one axis (rectangles/triangles only)
  - Top/bottom for height adjustment
  - Left/right for width adjustment
- Minimum size enforced (5% of region)
- Anchored at opposite corner/edge

### Rotation
- Drag rotation handle in circular motion
- Angle calculated from shape center to cursor
- 0° points upward
- Range: 0-360° (wraps around)
- Visual rotation around shape center

## Technical Details

### Coordinate Systems

The implementation handles three coordinate systems:

1. **Normalized Region Space (0-1)**: Shape instance data storage
2. **Canvas Pixel Space**: Visual rendering and calculations
3. **Parent (Viewport) Space**: Hit testing with zoom/pan applied

Conversions are handled automatically by each layer, ensuring correct behavior at all zoom levels and pan positions.

### Layering Architecture

```
Canvas Content (canvas space):
  ├─ Device image (base layer)
  ├─ RegionOverlay (region marching ants)
  └─ ShapeInstanceOverlay (shape marching ants)

Overlay Content (parent space):
  ├─ RegionHitLayer (region manipulation)
  ├─ ShapeInstanceHitLayer (shape manipulation)
  └─ External overlays (e.g., detection boxes)
```

### Gesture State Machine

```
Idle → Selected → Dragging → Idle
          ↓
        Resizing → Idle
          ↓
        Rotating → Idle
```

Each operation maintains proper state and provides appropriate cursor feedback on macOS.

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Three new unit tests added to `ControlShapeTests.swift`:
- `testShapeInstanceCreation`: Verifies property initialization
- `testShapeInstanceCodable`: Tests JSON encoding/decoding
- `testShapeInstancesInRegion`: Tests multiple instances

### Manual Testing Checklist
