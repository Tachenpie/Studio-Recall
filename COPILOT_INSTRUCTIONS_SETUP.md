```

## File Details

### 1. Repository-Wide Instructions
**File**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (7.2KB)

Provides general guidelines that apply to all code:
- Project overview and core technologies
- Build and test procedures
- Swift code style guidelines
- Architecture patterns (ObservableObject, @MainActor, etc.)
- Data model overview
- JSON persistence patterns
- Platform-specific code (#if os(macOS))
- Security and best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Documentation standards

### 2. Path-Specific Instructions

#### Models (`models.instructions.md`, 3.3KB)
Applies to: `Studio Recall/Models/**`

Guidelines for:
- Codable conformance requirements
- UUID-based identity patterns
- Enum patterns and control state management
- Rack grid logic and device placement
- Coordinate systems (normalized, pixel, CGImage)
- Visual mappings
- Critical rules for data integrity

#### Views (`views.instructions.md`, 5.1KB)
Applies to: `Studio Recall/Views/**`

Guidelines for:
- SwiftUI view architecture
- State management (@State, @Binding, @EnvironmentObject)
- Platform-specific views (#if os(macOS))
- Control rendering (photoreal vs representative modes)
- Hit testing and drag-and-drop
- Canvas and coordinate systems
- Metal rendering
- Accessibility and performance

#### Tests (`tests.instructions.md`, 7.5KB)
Applies to: `Studio RecallTests/**` and `Studio RecallUITests/**`

Guidelines for:
- Unit test structure and naming conventions
- Codable conformance tests
- Backward compatibility tests
- State management tests
- Edge case tests
- Test fixtures and mocking
- Performance tests
- Asynchronous tests

#### Managers (`managers.instructions.md`, 9.1KB)
Applies to: `Studio Recall/Managers/**` and `Studio Recall/Handlers/**`

Guidelines for:
- Manager architecture (@MainActor, ObservableObject)
- SessionManager and DeviceLibrary patterns
- Unowned references to avoid retain cycles
- JSON persistence (load/save)
- Device placement logic (2D racks, 1D chassis)
- Control value updates
- Device reconciliation after library changes
- Error handling and graceful degradation

#### Utilities (`utilities.instructions.md`, 11KB)
Applies to: `Studio Recall/Utilities/**` and `Studio Recall/Extensions/**`

Guidelines for:
- Extension organization and best practices
- Utility file structure (stateless, focused)
- Image, geometry, and color utilities
- Coordinate system conversion helpers
- Mask generation utilities
- File management utilities
- Platform-specific utilities
- Value mapping and interpolation
- Validation utilities
- Performance utilities

### 3. Documentation
**File**: `.github/README.md` (5.4KB)

Comprehensive documentation of:
- Instruction file structure
- How each file is used by Copilot
- Topics covered in each instruction file
- Benefits of the instruction system
- Maintenance guidelines
- References to related documentation

## How It Works

When GitHub Copilot coding agent works on files in this repository:

1. **Always Reads**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for general context
2. **Path-Based**: Automatically reads relevant path-specific instruction files
3. **Combined Context**: Uses both general and specific instructions for suggestions

### Example Flow

When editing `Studio Recall/Models/Device.swift`:
1. Copilot reads `copilot-instructions.md` (general guidelines)
2. Copilot reads `instructions/models.instructions.md` (model-specific guidelines)
3. Copilot provides suggestions following both sets of rules

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent Code Style**: All AI suggestions follow established patterns
✅ **Better Context**: Path-specific instructions provide deep domain knowledge
✅ **Fewer Mistakes**: Guidelines prevent common pitfalls and anti-patterns
✅ **Faster Development**: Less time explaining requirements
✅ **Better Onboarding**: New contributors get automatic guidance
✅ **Maintainability**: Instructions serve as living documentation

## Alignment with Best Practices

This implementation follows [GitHub's best practices for Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/coding-agent/get-the-best-results):

1. ✅ **Well-Scoped Instructions**: Clear, specific guidelines for each area
2. ✅ **Custom Instructions**: Using `.instructions.md` format with frontmatter
3. ✅ **Path-Based Scoping**: Instructions apply to relevant code paths only
4. ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major code areas covered
5. ✅ **Project Context**: Includes architecture, patterns, and conventions
6. ✅ **Documentation**: Well-documented for maintainability

## Relationship to CLAUDE.md

The repository already has `CLAUDE.md` (for Claude AI assistant). The new Copilot instructions:

- **Complement** CLAUDE.md with Copilot-specific format
- **Adapt** architecture knowledge from CLAUDE.md into Copilot guidelines
- **Focus on** actionable coding guidelines rather than architectural overview
- **Maintain consistency** with patterns documented in CLAUDE.md

Both files serve similar purposes but target different AI assistants:
- **CLAUDE.md**: Detailed architecture for Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
- **Copilot instructions**: Actionable guidelines for GitHub Copilot coding agent

## Total Size

- 7 files created
- ~43KB total instruction content
- Comprehensive coverage of all code areas

## Maintenance

To keep instructions current:

1. **Update after major changes**: Keep instructions in sync with code patterns
2. **Add for new features**: Document new patterns and conventions
3. **Remove outdated info**: Clean up for removed features
4. **Test suggestions**: Verify Copilot provides helpful guidance
