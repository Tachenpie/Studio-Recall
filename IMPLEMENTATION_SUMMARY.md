# Implementation Summary: Direct Shape Instance Manipulation

## Overview

This implementation adds direct manipulation capabilities for shape instances in the FaceplateCanvas, eliminating the need for slider-based controls in the ControlInspector. It also restores the marching ants visual feedback system for individual shape instances.

## Problem Statement

The original simplified shapes system required users to adjust shape instance position, size, and rotation using sliders in the ControlInspector. This approach had several drawbacks:
1. Not intuitive - required switching between canvas and inspector
2. Cluttered interface - many sliders for each shape instance
3. Lack of spatial context - hard to position shapes accurately
4. No visual feedback - unclear which shape was being edited

## Solution

### New Components

#### 1. ShapeInstanceOverlay.swift
**Purpose**: Visual-only overlay for selected shape instances

**Features**:
- Marching ants outline (dashed black/white strokes with phase offset)
- 8 resize handles (4 corners + 4 edges)
- Rotation handle (circle above shape with connecting line)
- Handles automatically scale with zoom level
- Overlay rotates with the shape

**Rendering**:
- Rendered in canvas space
- Uses same coordinate system as RegionOverlay
- Path generation matches actual shape geometry (circle, rectangle, triangle)

#### 2. ShapeInstanceHitLayer.swift
**Purpose**: Interactive layer for direct manipulation

**Features**:
- Click to select any shape instance
- Drag to move (when no handle is grabbed)
- Drag corner handles to resize
- Drag edge handles to resize along one axis (rectangles/triangles only)
- Drag rotation handle to rotate
- Proper cursor feedback (resize arrows, hand, crosshair)

**Gesture Handling**:
- Three gesture types: move, resize, rotate
- Selection happens on first contact
- Only selected shapes can be edited (prevents accidental edits)
- Constraints: minimum size (5%), canvas boundaries (0-1)

**Coordinate Conversion**:
- Handles parent space (viewport with zoom/pan)
- Converts gestures to normalized region space (0-1)
- Properly accounts for zoom and pan transformations

#### 3. FaceplateCanvas.swift Updates
**Changes**:
- Added `@State private var selectedShapeInstanceId: UUID?`
- Integrated ShapeInstanceOverlay in canvas content section
- Integrated ShapeInstanceHitLayer in overlay section
- Creates layers for each shape instance in the active region
- Binds shape instance data for live updates

**Layering**:
```
Canvas Content (canvas space):
  - Device image
  - Control hit overlays
  - RegionOverlay (marching ants for region)
  - ShapeInstanceOverlay (marching ants for selected shape)

Overlay Content (parent space with zoom/pan):
  - RegionHitLayer (region manipulation)
  - ShapeInstanceHitLayer (shape manipulation)
  - External overlays (e.g., detection boxes)
```

#### 4. ControlInspector.swift Updates
**Changes Removed**:
- Position X slider
- Position Y slider
- Width slider
- Height slider
- Rotation slider

**Changes Added**:
- Instructional text: "Drag shape directly in the canvas to adjust position, size, and rotation."

**Kept Unchanged**:
- Shape type picker (circle, rectangle, triangle)
- "Add Shape" button
- "Remove" button for each shape
- Shape instance list

## Technical Details

### Coordinate Systems

Three coordinate systems are used:

1. **Normalized Region Space (0-1)**
   - Shape instance position and size are stored here
   - Independent of actual canvas size or zoom level
   - Position (0.5, 0.5) is always center of region

2. **Canvas Pixel Space**
   - Used for rendering in canvas content
   - Region rect multiplied by canvas size
   - Shape instance position/size relative to region rect

3. **Parent (Viewport) Space**
   - Used for hit testing and gestures
   - Includes zoom and pan transformations
   - Gestures captured here, then converted to normalized space

### Shape Path Generation

All three simplified shapes have consistent path generation:

**Circle**:
```swift
path.addEllipse(in: rect)
```

**Rectangle**:
```swift
path.addRect(rect)
```

**Triangle** (equilateral, pointing up):
```swift
let topPoint = CGPoint(x: rect.midX, y: rect.minY)
let bottomLeft = CGPoint(x: rect.minX, y: rect.maxY)
let bottomRight = CGPoint(x: rect.maxX, y: rect.maxY)
path.move(to: topPoint)
path.addLine(to: bottomRight)
path.addLine(to: bottomLeft)
path.closeSubpath()
```

### Resize Logic

**Corners** (all shapes):
- Anchored at opposite corner
- For circles: maintains square aspect ratio
- For rectangles/triangles: independent width/height

**Edges** (rectangles/triangles only):
- Anchored at opposite edge
- Adjusts only one dimension (width or height)
- Center stays fixed on perpendicular axis

**Constraints**:
- Minimum size: 0.05 (5% of region)
- Maximum size: 1.0 (full region)
- Position clamped to 0-1 range

### Rotation Logic

- Calculated from shape center to cursor position
- Uses `atan2(dy, dx)` for angle
- Adjusted so 0° points upward (not rightward)
- Range: 0-360° (wraps around)
- Visual rotation applies around shape center

### Selection Logic

- Clicking any shape instance calls `onSelect()` callback
- Callback sets `selectedShapeInstanceId` in FaceplateCanvas
- Only shapes with matching ID show handles and accept edits
- All shapes respond to click for selection

## Data Model

No changes to the data model were required. The existing `ShapeInstance` struct already supports all necessary properties:

```swift
struct ShapeInstance: Codable, Equatable, Identifiable {
    var id: UUID = UUID()
    var shape: ImageRegionShape = .circle
    var position: CGPoint = CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0.5)  // Region space (0-1)
    var size: CGSize = CGSize(width: 0.3, height: 0.3)  // Region space (0-1)
    var rotation: Double = 0  // Degrees (0-360)
    var fillColor: CodableColor?
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests Added

In `ControlShapeTests.swift`:

1. **testShapeInstanceCreation**
   - Verifies all properties are set correctly
   - Tests default values

2. **testShapeInstanceCodable**
   - Tests JSON encoding/decoding
   - Verifies all properties persist correctly

3. **testShapeInstancesInRegion**
   - Tests multiple shape instances in a region
   - Verifies array persistence through JSON

### Manual Testing Required

The following should be tested manually in Xcode:

1. **Selection**
   - Click different shape instances
   - Verify only one can be selected at a time
   - Verify handles appear only for selected shape

2. **Movement**
   - Drag shape to move
   - Verify stays within region bounds
   - Verify smooth tracking

3. **Corner Resize**
   - Drag each corner handle
   - Verify proper anchoring at opposite corner
   - For circles: verify square aspect ratio maintained
   - For rectangles/triangles: verify independent scaling

4. **Edge Resize**
   - Drag each edge handle (rectangles/triangles)
   - Verify single-axis scaling
   - Verify opposite edge stays fixed

5. **Rotation**
   - Drag rotation handle in circular motion
   - Verify smooth rotation tracking
   - Verify 0° points upward

6. **Zoom/Pan**
   - Test all operations at various zoom levels
   - Test with canvas panned in different directions
   - Verify handles scale appropriately

7. **Multiple Shapes**
   - Add multiple shape instances
   - Verify each can be selected and edited independently
   - Verify overlapping shapes can both be selected

## Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **100% Compatible**
- No changes to JSON structure
- No changes to data models
- Existing sessions load and work correctly
- Shape instances created with sliders work with direct manipulation

### Forward Compatibility

✅ **Slider-free design is permanent**
- Sliders removed, not hidden
- Direct manipulation is the only way to adjust shapes
- More intuitive and professional workflow

### Cross-Platform

⚠️ **macOS Only Currently**
- Hit layers use macOS cursors (`NSCursor`)
- Gestures optimized for mouse/trackpad
- iOS/tvOS would require touch gesture adaptation

## Limitations and Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Touch Interface**: Not optimized for iPad/iOS touch input
2. **Small Shapes**: Handles may overlap on very small shapes (< 10% of region)
3. **Edge Cases**: Rotation handle may be off-screen if shape is at top edge
4. **Single Selection**: Only one shape can be selected at a time

### Future Enhancements

See Documentation/SHAPE_INSTANCE_DIRECT_MANIPULATION.md for detailed enhancement ideas, including:
- Keyboard modifiers (Shift for constrained movement, etc.)
- Snap-to-grid functionality
- Multi-selection support
- Alignment and distribution tools
- Optional numeric input for precision
